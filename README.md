### Introduction
Kart is an app that allows users to create a shopping list that updates in real-time! Future feature allows users to create shared shopping lists

### Setup
Setup is simple since you just need to run `npm start` (if you have npm installed) and the app is up and running!

### Testing
I've made test specs if you wish to run tests on the app features.  
1. `static_spec.js` which tests the landing page.
2. `user_spec.js` which tests behavior of account creation.
3. `users_spec.js` which tests for user resource.


All can be run with `npm test spec/(spec_folder)/(test_spec_here.js)`.
(Further specs will be available when features are in progress)

### Usage
Launching the app brings you to the landing site in which you can get started by creating an account. After, you'll be presented with the option to get started in creating a list or viewing your created lists.
